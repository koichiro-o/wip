### sObject Describe

Completely describes the individual metadata at all levels for the specified object. For example, this can be used to retrieve the fields,
URLs, and child relationships for the Account object.

[For more information about the metadata that is retrieved, see DescribesObjectResult in the SOAP API Developers Guide.](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.252.0.api.meta/api/sforce_api_calls_describesobjects_describesobjectresult.htm)

You can use the `If-Modified-Since` or `If-Unmodified-Since` header with this resource. When using the
`If-Modified-Since` header, if no available objectâ€™s metadata has changed since the provided date, a `304 Not Modified`
status code is returned with no response body.
