### Search for Records Suggested by Autocomplete and Instant Results

Returns a list of suggested records whose names match the user’s search string. The suggestions resource provides autocomplete results
and instant results for users to navigate directly to likely relevant records, before performing a full search. This resource is available in
REST API version 32.0 and later.

The suggestions resource returns records when the record’s name field includes the exact text in the search string. The last term in the
search string can match the beginning of a word. Records that contain the search string within a word aren’t considered a match.

Note: If the user’s search query contains quotation marks or wildcards, those symbols are automatically removed from the query
string in the URI.

For example, the text string `national u` is treated as `national u*` and returns “National Utility”, “National Urban Company”,
and “First National University”.

The suggestions resource returns display-ready data about likely relevant records that the user can access. A relevance algorithm
determines the order of results. Each suggested record in the results contains these elements:

```
Attributes

```

The record’s object type and the URL for accessing the record.

Also includes the requested lookup fields’ values. For example, if you requested
```
fields=Id,Name, the result would include the ID and name.

```

`Name` (or `Title)` The record’s Name field. In the absence of a standard Name field, the Title field is used
for these objects:

**•** Dashboard

**•** Idea

**•** IdeaTheme

**•** Note

**•** Question

In the absence of a standard Name or Title field, the main identifying field is used. For
example, in cases, the Case Number is used.

`Id` The record’s unique identifier.

The suggestions resource supports all searchable objects except the following.

**•** ContentNote

**•** Event

**•** External objects

**•** FeedComment

**•** FeedPost

**•** IdeaComment

**•** Pricebook2

**•** Reply

**•** TagDefinition

**•** Task

**Request body**
None required

**Request parameters**

**Parameter** **Description**

`fields` Optional. Used for creating lookup queries. Specify multiple fields using a
comma-separated list. Specifies which lookup fields to be returned in the response.

`dynamicFields` Optional. Available in API version 48.0 and later. Used to return additional dynamic
fields. Specify multiple options using a comma-separated list. For example, if

`dynamicFields=secondaryField` then each suggested record in the results
contains an additional field besides `Id` and `Name` (or `Title) based on the next`
eligible field in the search layout.

`groupId` Optional. Specifies one or more unique identifiers of one or more groups that the
question to return was posted to. Specify multiple groups using a comma-separated

list. This parameter is only applicable when the parameter type equals `question.`
Don’t use with the `userId.`

`ignoreUnsupportedSObjects` Optional. If an unsupported object is included in a request, this parameter indicates
what action to take. If it’s set to `false, an error is returned. If it’s set to` `true, the`

object is ignored and no error is returned. See the Unsupported Objects section for
reference. The default is `false.`

```
limit

```

Optional. Specifies the maximum number of suggested records to return. If a limit isn’t
specified, 5 records are returned by default. If there are more suggested records than
the limit specified, the response body’s `hasMoreResults` property is `true.`


`networkId` Optional. Specifies one or more unique identifiers for the Experience Cloud sites to
return the question to. Specify multiple sites using a comma-separated list. This

parameter is only applicable when the parameter `type` equals `question` or
parameter `sobject` equals `user.`

`q` Required. The user’s search query string, properly URL-encoded. Suggestions are
returned only if the user’s query string meets the minimum length requirements: one

character for queries in Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Thai; three characters for all
other languages. Query strings that exceed the maximum length of 255 characters (or
200 consecutive characters without a space break) return an error.

```
sobject

```

Required. The objects that the search is scoped to, such as Account or offer__c.

If the `sobject` value is `feedItem, the` `type parameter is required and it must`
have a value of `question.`

Specify up to 10 objects with a comma-separated list. For example:
```
sobject=Account,Contact,Lead. To take advantage of the feature, activate

```
the CrossObjectTypeahead permission.

```
topicId
type

```

To specify the specific fields to return by object, use the following syntax with multiple
fields in a comma-separated list. The `sobject` is lowercase.
```
sobject=sobject.fields=fields

```
For example:
```
&sobject=Account,Contact,Lead&account.fields=Website,Phone
&contact.fields=Phone

```
Optional. Specifies the unique identifier of the single topic that the question to return
was tagged as. This parameter is only applicable when the parameter `type` equals
```
question.

```
Required when the `sobject` value is `feedItem. Including this parameter for all`
other `sobject` values doesn’t affect the query. Specifies that the type of Feed is
questions. Valid value: `question.`


`userId` Optional. Specifies one or more unique identifiers of one or more users who authored
the question to return. Specify multiple users using a comma-separated list. This

parameter is only applicable when the parameter type equals `question. Don’t use`
with the `groupId.`

`useSearchScope` Optional. Available in API version 40.0 and later. The default value is false. If false,
the objects specified in the request are used to suggest records. If `true, in addition`

to the objects specified in the request, the user's search scope is used to suggest records.
The search scope is the list of objects a user uses most frequently.

**•** If the request doesn’t specify an object, use `useSearchScope=true.`

**•** If `useSearchScope=true` and the user's search scope is empty, the default
search scope is used to suggest records.

**•** Typically, only the first 10 objects are used to suggest records. However, an admin
can assign objects that are always considered when returning results. If configured,
up to 15 objects are used to suggest records. For more information about assigning
[objects, see Assign Search Results Objects to Users (Beta).](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.search_ai_assign_result_objs.htm&language=en_US)

**•** Objects specified in the `sobject` parameter are prioritized over objects in the
user's search scope.

**•** Values for the `ignoreUnsupportedSObjects` parameter aren’t applied
to the objects in the search scope.

This example uses only the search scope.
```
                  .../search/suggestions?q=Acme&useSearchScope=true

```
This example uses the search scope and the Account object.

  where

#### Example

```
**Example Response Body**


Optional. A filter that follows the same syntax as the SOQL WHERE clause. URLs encode
the expression.

Use the clause for an object, or globally for all compatible objects. An example of an
object-specific clause is:
```
account.where=name%20LIKE%20%27Smith%25%27. An example of a

```
global clause is: where=name%20LIKE%20%27Smith%25%27. The parameter
must be lower case. Any object-specific `where` clauses override the global `where`
clause. You can’t use this parameter for the Question object.

To specify multiple entities, see the following example. This feature is available in
version 38.0 and later.
