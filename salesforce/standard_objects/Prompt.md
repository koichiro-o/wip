#### Prompt

Represents record details about an in-app guidance prompt or walkthrough. Available in API version 46.0 and later.

Important: Where possible, we changed noninclusive terms to align with our company value of Equality. Because changing
terms in our code can break current implementations, we maintained this object’s name.

Prompts and walkthroughs help users discover your products and services, adopt your processes, or learn how to use a new feature.
Add prompts and walkthroughs in Lightning Experience pages or apps or in supported Experience Cloud site pages. Add an optional
action button or link that goes to a URL. Track views, action button clicks, and walkthrough completions.

##### Fields

```
DeveloperName
Language

```

**Type**
string

**Properties**
Create, Filter, Group, Sort, Update

**Description**
The unique name of the object in the API. This name can contain only underscores and
alphanumeric characters, and must be unique in your org. It must begin with a letter, not
include spaces, not end with an underscore, and not contain two consecutive underscores.
In managed packages, this field prevents naming conflicts on package installations. With
this field, a developer can change the object’s name in a managed package and the changes
are reflected in a subscriber’s organization.

Note: When creating large sets of data, always specify a unique DeveloperName
for each record. If no DeveloperName is specified, performance slows down while
Salesforce generates one for each record.

**Type**
picklist

**Properties**
Create, Defaulted on create, Filter, Group, Nillable, Restricted picklist, Sort, Update

**Description**
Indicates the language used in the org where the in-app guidance was created.
