**Description**
Name of the role played by the contact on this case, such as Technical Contact, Business
Contact, Decision Maker, and so on. Must be uniqueâ€”there can't be multiple records in
which the CaseId, ContactId, and Role values are identical. Different contacts can
play the same role on the same case. A contact can play different roles on the same case.


Use this object to define the role that a given Case plays on a given Contact. For example, you can use this object to be able to see all
contacts who are associated to a case, or, given a contact, be able to query all cases that they are associated with, even if they are not
the primary contact on the case.
