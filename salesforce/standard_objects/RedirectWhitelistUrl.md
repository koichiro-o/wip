#### RedirectWhitelistUrl

Represents a trusted URL for external user redirections. Redirections to a different Salesforce org, including its publicly served pages and
content, are allowed from your Salesforce org only when the URL is a RedirectWhitelistUrl. For non-Salesforce URLs, a session setting
controls whether redirections from pages and components built in Salesforce Classic are restricted to RedirectWhitelistUrl objects. Except
for cross-org redirections, you can’t restrict redirections that originate from pages and components built with Lightning Experience. This
object is available in API version 48.0 and later.

Important: Where possible, we changed noninclusive terms to align with our company value of Equality. Because changing
terms in our code can break current implementations, we maintained this object’s name.

##### Supported Calls
```
create(), delete(), describeSObjects(), query(), retrieve(), update(), upsert()

 Special Access Rules

```
Only authenticated internal and external users with the View Setup and Configuration permission can access this object, and only users
with the Customize Application permission can edit it.

##### Fields

```

**Type**

```
Language
MasterLabel
NamespacePrefix

**Properties**
Create, Filter, Group, Sort, Update

**Description**
The unique name of the custom help section in the API. This name can contain only
underscores and alphanumeric characters and must be unique in your organization. It must
begin with a letter, not include spaces, not end with an underscore, and not contain two
consecutive underscores. The label corresponds to the section title in the user interface.
Limit: 80 characters.

When creating large sets of data, always specify a unique `DeveloperName` for each
record. If no `DeveloperName` is specified, performance slows down while Salesforce
generates one for each record.

Only users with View DeveloperName OR View Setup and Configuration permission can
view, group, sort, and filter this field.

**Description**
The namespace prefix that is associated with this object. Each Developer Edition org that
creates a managed package has a unique namespace prefix. Limit: 15 characters. You can
refer to a component in a managed package by using the
```
  namespacePrefix__componentName notation.

```
The namespace prefix can have one of the following values.

**•** In Developer Edition orgs, `NamespacePrefix` is set to the namespace prefix of the
org for all objects that support it, unless an object is in an installed managed package.
In that case, the object has the namespace prefix of the installed managed package. This

##### Usage

```

field’s value is the namespace prefix of the Developer Edition org of the package
developer.

**•** In orgs that are not Developer Edition orgs, NamespacePrefix is set only for objects
that are part of an installed managed package. All other objects have no namespace
prefix.

**Type**

**Description**
The trusted URL.

These formats are accepted: `example.com,` `*.example.com, and`
```
  https://example.com.

```
The host section of the URL can include an asterisk (*) as a wildcard. Otherwise, the URL
cannot be malformed. Examples of malformed URLs that fail a syntax check are
```
  malformed^url.example.com, and https://{subdomain}.example.com.

```
To add a URL to a RedirectWhitelistUrl based on parameters, build the URL before
you update the `Url field.`


Only redirections are restricted to the URLs in this object. A direct anchor link to an external URL is always allowed, even if that URL isn’t
in the allowlist. An example of a direct anchor link is `<a href="targetUrl">linkText</a>.`

Redirections include parameters that redirect the user and anchor links that include a redirection. For example, this anchor link includes
a redirection: `<a href="/?startURL=targetUrl">linkText</a>. And this form action redirects the user through the`
`saveURL` parameter: `<form action="/xyz?saveURL=targetURL">.`

If the `targetUrl` belongs to another Salesforce org, the redirection is permitted only when the target URL is a RedirectWhitelistUrl.

If the targetUrl isn’t a Salesforce org URL, the redirection is checked against the RedirectWhitelistUrl object only when both of these
conditions are met.

**•** The redirection originates from a Salesforce Classic page or component.

**•** Either the redirectBlockModeEnabled or redirectionWarning [SessionSettings field in the SecuritySettings Metadata](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.254.0.api_meta.meta/api_meta/meta_securitysettings.htm)
API is `true.`

Note: Salesforce verifies the initial redirection outside of Salesforce against the RedirectWhitelistUrl object. However, Salesforce
can’t verify subsequent redirections. For example, if a link on a Visualforce page takes the user to https://www.example.com,
Salesforce verifies that you allowed redirections to https://www.example.com. If that URL then redirects the user to
https://spam.example.com, Salesforce can’t check that redirection, because it occurs outside of Salesforce.

For non-Salesforce URLs, you can choose whether to alert users about untrusted external redirections or to block those redirections
entirely via the redirectBlockModeEnabled and redirectionWarning fields on the SecuritySettings metadata API type.
These restrictions apply only to redirections from pages and components built in Salesforce Classic.


-----

There’s one last special case to cover. For Salesforce org URLs, Salesforce always allows redirections to URLs within the same org, including
redirections from previous My Domain URLs. When the `enableCrossOrgRedirect` field on the SecuritySettings metadata API
type is `false, Salesforce checks user redirections to other Salesforce orgs via a direct link, a post-action URL, or a post-login URL. If the`
URL isn’t a RedirectWhitelistURL, the user isn’t redirected. An example of a direct link is `<a`
```
href="https://www.example.com”>example.com</a>. Post-action URLs and post-login URLs use a protected URL

```
redirect parameter, such as `retURL,` `startURL,` `saveURL,` `cancelURL, and` `targetURL.`
