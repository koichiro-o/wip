Use FieldChangeSnapshot to learn about the first change made to the specified opportunity during the specified time period. Subsequent
changes are not returned.

Example: Suppose that last week you changed an opportunity's close date to June 1, 2021. Assuming the opportunity had the
ID '006R0000XXXXXXXXXX', the following query would return the `CurrentValueDateOnly` of June 1, 2021:
```
   Select CurrentValueDateOnly from FieldChangeSnapshot where ParentID =
   '006R0000XXXXXXXXXX' and FieldName = 'CloseDate' and ValidTo = LAST_WEEK AND ValidFrom
   = LAST_WEEK and CurrentValueDateOnly < 2021-07-01
