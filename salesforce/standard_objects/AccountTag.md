AccountTag stores the relationship between its parent TagDefinition and the Account being tagged. Tag objects act as metadata,
allowing users to describe and organize their data.

When a tag is deleted, its parent TagDefinition will also be deleted if the name is not being used; otherwise, the parent remains. Deleting
a TagDefinition sends it to the Recycle Bin, along with any associated tag entries.
