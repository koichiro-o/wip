Stores the order item information used in the invoicing process. This object is available in API version 55.0 and later.

When you activate an order, Subscription Management creates one billing schedule for each order item in an order. For example, if an
order contains 15 order items, Subscription Management creates 15 billing schedules, one billing schedule for each item. The invoice
scheduler uses the information in the billing schedule to determine when it's time to invoice an order item.

Billing schedules for all order items that are generated from one asset are summarized in a billing schedule group.
