Use this object to list all notes, attachments, documents uploaded to libraries in Salesforce CRM Content, and files added to Chatter for
a record, such as a related list on a detail page.

To determine if an object supports the CombinedAttachment object, call `describeSObject()` on the object. For example,
`describeSObject('Account')` returns all the child relationships of the Account object, including CombinedAttachment.
You can then query the CombinedAttachment child relationship.
```
SELECT Name, (SELECT Title FROM CombinedAttachments)
FROM Account

```
You canâ€™t directly query CombinedAttachment.
