At every login, the device the login request is from is checked against the known devices using ClientBrowser. A match means a cookie
was found on the browser that matches an entry in the ClientBrowser table, so the device is known. No match means that no matching
cookie was found, so the device is unknown, and the user is asked to confirm their identity.
