Important: Where possible, we changed noninclusive terms to align with our company value of Equality. Because changing
terms in our code can break current implementations, we maintained this objectâ€™s name.

##### Usage

This object represents a value in the case status picklist. The case status picklist provides additional information about the status of a
Case, such as whether a given `Status` value represents an open or closed case. Query the CaseStatus object to retrieve the set of
values in the case status picklist, and then use that information while processing Case records to determine more information about a
given case. For example, the application could test whether a given case is open or closed based on its `Status` value and the value
of the `IsClosed` property in the associated CaseStatus object.
