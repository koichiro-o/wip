**Description**

This field is never read-enabled, though it is write-enabled. A request for this
value always returns `null. The value must be a base32-encoded string of a`
20-byte secret.

You can use the Apex method
`Auth.SessionManagement.getQrCode()` to get a value to write to
this field.

Note: If you write a secret to this field, in API version 37.0 and later the
user gets an email notification that a new identity verification method
was added to the user’s account.

[In API version 34.0 and later, this object was enhanced to help manage high instance counts. A query() call returns up to 500 rows.](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.254.0.api.meta/api/sforce_api_calls_query.htm)
[A queryMore()call returns 500 more, up to 2500 total. No more records are returned after 2500.](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.254.0.api.meta/api/sforce_api_calls_querymore.htm)

To make sure that you don’t miss any records, issue a `COUNT()` query in a SELECT clause for TwoFactorMethodInfo. This query gives
you the total number of records. If there are more than 2500 records, use these options to manage your results.

**•** Divide queries by filtering on fields like `UserId` to return subsets of less than 2500 records.

**•** Use `OFFSET` to get batches of 2500 records. Start with an `OFFSET` of 0 and then increment by 2500. If you use this option, we
recommend that you also use `LIMIT` to limit each query to 2500.

For example, use an initial query with this structure.
```
  SELECT <desired fields> FROM TwoFactorMethodsInfo LIMIT 2500 OFFSET 0

```
Then, run another query with an offset of 2500.
```
  SELECT <desired fields> FROM TwoFactorMethodsInfo LIMIT 2500 OFFSET 2500

```
Continue to increase the offset by 2500 until you have results for all records.
