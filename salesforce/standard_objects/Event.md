#### Event

Represents an event in the calendar. In the user interface, event and task records are collectively referred to as activities.

Important: Where possible, we changed noninclusive terms to align with our company value of Equality. We maintained certain
terms to avoid any effect on customer implementations.

Note:

**•** An EventRelation object can’t be related to a child event, and child events don’t include the invitee related list.

**•** `query(),` `delete(), and` `update() aren’t allowed with events related to more than one contact in API versions 25.0`
and earlier.

**•** `create()` and `update()` aren’t available for read-only fields on Lightning Experience event series.

**•** `upsert()` and `undelete()` aren’t supported for syncing changes made to events through the API using the feature
Lightning Sync.

##### Supported Calls
```
create(), delete(), describeLayout(), describeSObjects(), getDeleted(), getUpdated(), query(),
retrieve(), search(), undelete(), update(), upsert()

```

##### Fields

**Field**
```
AcceptedEventInviteeIds
AccountId
ActivityDate

```

**Type**
JunctionIdList

**Properties**
Create, Update

**Description**
A string array of contact or lead IDs who accepted this event. This JunctionIdList is
linked to the `AcceptedEventRelation` child relationship.

Warning: Adding a JunctionIdList field name to the `fieldsToNull`
property deletes all related junction records. This action can’t be undone.

**Type**
reference

**Properties**
Filter, Group, Nillable, Sort

**Description**
Represents the ID of the related account. The `AccountId` is determined as follows.

If the value of WhatId is any of the following objects, then Salesforce uses that object’s
```
  AccountId.

```
**•** Account

**•** Opportunity

**•** Contract

**•** Custom object that’s a child of Account

If the value of the `WhatId field is any other object, and the value of the WhoId` field is a
contact object, then Salesforce uses that contact’s AccountId. If your org uses Shared
Activities, Salesforce uses the AccountId of the primary contact.

Otherwise, Salesforce sets the value of the `AccountId` field to null.

For information on IDs, see ID Field Type.

This is a relationship field.

**Description**
Contains the event length, in minutes. Even though this field represents a temporal value,
it’s an integer type—not a Date/Time type.

Required in API versions 12.0 and earlier if IsAllDayEvent is false.

In API versions 13.0 and later, this field is optional, depending on the following:

**•** If IsAllDayEvent is true, you can supply a value for either DurationInMinutes
or EndDateTime. Supplying values in both fields is allowed if the values add up to
the same amount of time. If both fields are null, the duration defaults to one day.

is `Name ID.`

If the JunctionIdList field is used, all `WhoIds are included in the relationship list.`

Beginning in API version 37.0, if the contact or lead ID in the WhoId field isn't in the
`EventWhoIds` list, no error occurs and the ID is added to the EventWhoIds as the
primary WhoId. If WhoId is set to null, an arbitrary ID from the existing EventWhoIds
list is promoted to the primary position.

**Querying and Filtering Events**


-----

Queries on events are denied before they time out if they involve amounts of data that are deemed too large. In such cases, the exception
code `OPERATION_TOO_LARGE` is returned. If you receive OPERATION_TOO_LARGE, refactor your query to return or scan a
smaller amount of data.

When querying for events with a specific due date, you must filter on both the ActivityDateTimeand and `ActivityDate`
fields. For example to find all events with a due date of February 14, 2003, you need two filters:

**•** One filter with the `ActivityDate` field equal to the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) time zone on February 14, 2003.

**•** One filter with the ActivityDate field greater than or equal to midnight on February 14, 2003 in the user’s local time zone AND
less than or equal to midnight on February 15, 2003 in the user’s local time zone.

Alternatively, in API version 13.0 and later, you can find events with a specific due date by filtering on StartDateTime. For example,
to find all events with a due date of February 14, 2003, filter with the StartDateTime greater than or equal to midnight on February
14, 2003 in the user's local time zone AND less than or equal to midnight on February 15, 2003 in the user's local time zone.

The EventId field of an EventRelation object always points to the master record. An invitee on a group event can query the EventRelation
object to view the master record.

**Multiday Events**

**•** Multiday events are available in API version 13.0 and later. Also, in earlier versions SOQL queries don’t return multiday events.

**•** Multiday events are enabled through the user interface from Setup by entering `Activity Settings` in the `Quick Find`
box, then selecting Activity Settings.

**•** If the multiday event feature is enabled, then API versions 13.0 and later support values greater than 1440 for the
`DurationInMinutes` field. API versions 12.0 and earlier can’t access event objects whose DurationInMinutes is greater
than 1440.

**•** Multiday events can’t exceed 14 days.

**Event Series and Recurring Events**

In Lightning Experience, events with multiple occurrences are called event series, and are indicated when the IsRecurrence2 field
is set to true. In Salesforce Classic, events with multiple occurrences are called recurring events, and are indicated when the
`IsRecurrence` field is set to `true. Both fields can’t be set to true for the same event.`

**•** Lightning Experience event series are available in API version 44.0 and later as read-only fields. Recurrence patterns, specified by the
Recurrence2PatternText field, are creatable in API version 52.0 and later. Salesforce Classic recurring events are available in API version
7.0 and later. In earlier versions, SOQL queries don’t return any Lightning Experience event series.

**•** After an event is created, you can’t change the values of IsRecurrence2 or `IsRecurrence` from true to `false` or vice
versa.

**•** You can’t set fields associated with `IsRecurrence2` for events where `IsRecurrence` is set to `true, or vice versa.`

**•** For Lightning Experience event series where `IsRecurrence2 is` `true, if you’d like to delete a single or all remaining events,`
use the REST API call. For Salesforce Classic recurring events where IsRecurrence is `true, all past and future events in the`
series are removed when you delete the recurring event series through the API. However, when you delete the recurring event series
through the user interface, only future occurrences are removed.

**•** For Lightning Experience event series in API version 58.0 and later, when you change a future event, events in the entire series also
change. When you change a past event, IsRecurrence2Exception is set to true and only that past event changes.

**•** When creating a Salesforce Classic recurring event series, the duration of the event must be 24 hours or less. When the Salesforce
Classic recurring event series is created, you can extend the length of individual occurrences beyond 24 hours if Multiday events are
enabled; see Multiday Events.

**•** For Salesforce Classic recurring events, RecurrenceStartDateTime, RecurrenceEndDateOnly, RecurrenceType,
and any properties associated with the given recurrence type (see the Recurrence Field Usage for Salesforce Classic Recurring Events
table) must be populated.


-----

**•** When updating a Salesforce Classic recurring event series, it’s not possible to update the `EventRelation` for the event series
object and the EventRelation for the series object occurrences at the same time.

**•** Lightning Experience event series have no series ID, so it’s not possible to locate other occurrences in the series. In Salesforce Classic
recurring events, you can use `RecurrenceActivityId` to locate other occurrences.

**•** For both Lightning Experience event series and Salesforce Classic recurring events, when a series repeats every day, month, or year,
you can only schedule occurrences one time per day, month, or year. The week option lets you schedule occurrences multiple days
per week.

[Limits for Lightning Experience event series and limits for Salesforce Classic recurring events also apply.](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.creating_events_lex.htm&language=en_US)

**Lightning Experience Event Series and Recurring Events**

Use the Recurrence2PatternText field to specify the recurrence pattern for Lightning Experience event series. These recurrence
patterns, called reference rules or RRULES, support a subset of the RFC 5545 standards. This table includes common RRULE examples.

**Recurrence Pattern** **RRULE Example**

Every day for five days `RRULE:FREQ=DAILY;INTERVAL=1;COUNT=5`

Every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday with no `RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=1;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR`
end date

Every two weeks on Monday and Friday for 10 occurrences `RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=2;BYDAY=MO,FR;COUNT=10`

Monthly on the first day of the month until January 1, 2020 `RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;INTERVAL=1;BYMONTHDAY=1;UNTIL=20200101T100000Z`

Yearly on July 4th for three years (in this example, specify the date `RRULE:FREQ=YEARLY;INTERVAL=1;BYMONTH=7;BYMONTHDAY=4;COUNT=3`
using StartDateTime)

Daily until January 1, 2022 with no end date `RRULE:FREQ=DAILY;UNTIL=20220101T000000Z`

Every third Friday of the month with no end date `RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYSETPOS=3;BYDAY=FR`

The RRULE defined by `Recurrence2PatternText supports a subset of the RFC 5545 standard for internet calendaring and`
scheduling. Supported RRULE parts include FREQ, BYMONTH, BYMONTHDAY, BYDAY, WKST, BYSETPOS, INTERVAL, UNTIL, and COUNT.

When the event record is saved, the RRULE might be modified to follow the required format:

**•** The RRULE parts are placed in the following order: FREQ, BYMONTH, BYMONTHDAY, BYDAY, WKST, BYSETPOS, INTERVAL, UNTIL, and
COUNT.

**•** Any missing default values are inserted. For example, if the RRULE doesn't include INTERVAL, then `INTERVAL=1` is added.

**•** The RRULE is prefaced with `RRULE:` if that preface is missing.

|Recurrence Pattern|RRULE Example|
|---|---|
|Every day for five days|RRULE:FREQ=DAILY;INTERVAL=1;COUNT=5|
|Every Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday with no end date|RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=1;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR|
|Every two weeks on Monday and Friday for 10 occurrences|RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;INTERVAL=2;BYDAY=MO,FR;COUNT=10|
|Monthly on the first day of the month until January 1, 2020|RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;INTERVAL=1;BYMONTHDAY=1;UNTIL=20200101T100000Z|
|Yearly on July 4th for three years (in this example, specify the date using StartDateTime)|RRULE:FREQ=YEARLY;INTERVAL=1;BYMONTH=7;BYMONTHDAY=4;COUNT=3|
|Daily until January 1, 2022 with no end date|RRULE:FREQ=DAILY;UNTIL=20220101T000000Z|
|Every third Friday of the month with no end date|RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYSETPOS=3;BYDAY=FR|

|RRULE Part|Supported RFC 5545 Implementation|
|---|---|
|FREQ|Required. Indicates the type of recurrence rule. Allowed values are: • DAILY—supported parts include FREQ, INTERVAL, UNTIL, and COUNT. • WEEKLY—supported parts include INTERVAL, UNTIL, COUNT, BYDAY, and WKST. BYDAY is required, but can't be preceded by a number. For example, to indicate weekly on Tuesday and Thursday until September 1, 2023, use RRULE:FREQ=WEEKLY;UNTIL=20230901T000000Z;BYDAY=TU,TH • MONTHLY—supported patterns include:|


-----

|RRULE Part|Supported RFC 5545 Implementation|
|---|---|
||– BYMONTHDAY For example, to indicate monthly on the third day of the month use: RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYMONTHDAY=3 – BYDAY and BYSETPOS For example, to indicate the last weekday of the month, use RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR;BYSETPOS=-1 – BYDAY, where the BYDAY values are specified with a numeric value For example, to indicate monthly on the first Friday for 10 occurrences, use RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;COUNT=10;BYDAY=1FR • YEARLY—supported patterns include: – BYMONTH, BYDAY, and BYSETPOS For example, to indicate every year on the second Friday of January, use RRULE:FREQ=YEARLY;BYMONTH=1;BYDAY=FR;BYSETPOS=2 – BYMONTH and BYMONTHDAY For example, to indicate every year on October 31, use RRULE:FREQ=YEARLY;BYMONTH=10;BYMONTHDAY=31 For example, to create a maintenance pattern such as twice in May, and September on 7th and 15th; and one time in June/July/August on the 1st, use two RRULEs: RRULE: FREQ=MONTHLY; BYMONTH=5,9; BYMONTHDAY=7, 15 RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY; BYMONTH=6,7,8; BYMONTHDAY=1|
|BYMONTH|The month. Valid values are 1 to 12.|
|BYMONTHDAY|The day of the month. Valid values are 1 to 31. If BYMONTHDAY is 31 and the month has fewer than 31 days, the event is created on the last day of the month.|
|BYDAY|A comma-separated list of days of the week. Valid values are SU, MO, TU, WE, TH, FR, SA. For RRULES with yearly or monthly frequency, BYDAY must be one of: • a single day • weekend days • weekdays • every day of the week Each BYDAY value can be preceded by an integer that indicates the nth occurrence of a specific day within the monthly or yearly RRULE. Allowed values are -1, 1, 2, 3, and 4. You can't use different numbers in the BYDAY values. For example, this RRULE isn’t supported: RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;INTERVAL=2;COUNT=10;BYDAY=1SU,-1SU If BYDAY values are prefaced with a number, the RRULE can't include BYSETPOS.|
|WKST|Specifies the day on which the workweek starts. Valid values are MO, TU, WE, TH, FR, SA, and SU. Default value is based on the user's locale.|


-----

|RRULE Part|Supported RFC 5545 Implementation|
|---|---|
|BYSETPOS|A comma-separated list of values that correspond to the nth occurrence within the set of recurrence instances specified by the rule. Valid values are -1, 1, 2, 3, or 4. Default value is 1. For example, to indicate the last weekday of the month, use: RRULE:FREQ=MONTHLY;BYDAY=MO,TU,WE,TH,FR;BYSETPOS=-1|
|INTERVAL|The repetition interval. Valid values are: • an integer between 1 and 999 if FREQ=DAILY • an integer between 1 and 99 if FREQ=WEEKLY or FREQ=MONTHLY • 1 if FREQ=YEARLY Default value is 1.|
|UNTIL|Specifies the datetime in UTC format when the recurrence rule stops. The supported format is yyyyMMddTHHmmssZ, for example: 20210419T083000Z. An RRULE can't contain both UNTIL and COUNT. A recurring event without either UNTIL or COUNT repeats indefinitely.|
|COUNT|The number of occurrences. Allowed values are 1 to 999. An RRULE can't contain both UNTIL and COUNT. A recurring event without either UNTIL or COUNT repeats indefinitely.|
|BYWEEKNO|Specifies a comma-separated list of values that specify weeks of the year. Valid values are: • 1 to 53 • -53 to -1 For example, to indicate specific weeks in a year, use: RRULE: BYWEEKNO=20, -20. This rule part can’t be used when the FREQ rule part is set to anything other than YEARLY. For example, 3 represents the third week of the year. Note: Assuming a Monday week start, week 53 can only occur when Thursday is January 1 or if it’s a leap year and Wednesday is January 1.|
|BYYEARDAY|Specifies a comma-separated list of values that specify days of the year. Valid values are: • 1 to 366 • -366 to -1 For example, to indicate specific days in a year, use: RRULE:BYYEARDAY=1,100,200; or, RRULE:BYYEARDAY=1,-2.|


**Salesforce Classic Event Series and Recurring Events**

This table describes the usage of recurrence fields for Salesforce Classic recurring events. Each recurrence type must have all of its
properties set. All unused properties must be set to null.

**RecurrenceType Value** **Properties** **Example Pattern**

RecursDaily RecurrenceInterval Every second day


-----

RecursEveryWeekday RecurrenceDayOfWeekMask Every weekday - can’t be Saturday or Sunday

RecursMonthly RecurrenceDayOfMonth Every second month, on the third day of the month
RecurrenceInterval

RecursMonthlyNth RecurrenceInterval RecurrenceInstance Every second month, on the last Friday of the month
RecurrenceDayOfWeekMask

RecursWeekly RecurrenceInterval Every three weeks on Wednesday and Friday
RecurrenceDayOfWeekMask

RecursYearly RecurrenceDayOfMonth Every March on the 26th day of the month
RecurrenceMonthOfYear

RecursYearlyNth RecurrenceDayOfWeekMask The first Saturday in every October
RecurrenceInstanceRecurrenceMonthOfYear

**Attendees, Invitees, and Resources**

The field `GroupEventType` indicates that event participants are included on an event. You can add a resource to an event only
when the resource is available. The only attendance status that can be assigned to resources is Accepted. Events can’t be saved when
resources you’ve added aren’t available.

**JunctionIdList**

To create an event using JunctionIdList, IDs are pulled from the related contacts and both the event and the EventRelation
records are created in one API call. If the `EventRelation fails, the event is rolled back because it’s all done in a single API call.`
```
public void createEventNew(Contact[] contacts) {
 String[] contactIds = new String[contacts.size()];
 for (int i = 0; i < contacts.size(); i++) {
  contactIds[i] = contacts[i].getID();
 }
 Event event = new Event();
 event.setSubject("New Event");
 event.setEventWhoIds(contactIds);
 SaveResult[] results = null;
 try {
  results = connection.create(new Event[] {
  task
  });
 } catch (ConnectionException ce) {
  ce.printStackTrace();
 }
}

```
**Syncing Events with Lightning Sync**

Attendee statuses (Accepted or Maybe, Declined, or No Response) sync from Microsoft[®] Exchange or Google to Salesforce, but not from
Salesforce to Exchange or Google. Be wary of creating API flows that update attendee status in Salesforce for users set up to sync both
ways. Eventually the original Exchange or Google status overrides the update made in Salesforce.

**Shared Field-Level Security for Event and Task Objects**


-----

Metadata deployments for the Event object must include the field-level security for the Task object. Shared field-level security prevents
each object from changing the field-level security of the associated object.

Metadata deployments that include field-level security for only one of either the Event or Task objects can cause field-level security
changes to the other object that aren't reflected in the metadata.

**•** If field-level security is enabled for one object, then field-level security is enabled for both objects.

**•** If field-level security is disabled for one object, then it's disabled for both objects.

Note: A missing entry in the metadata is treated as field-level security being disabled.

##### Associated Objects

This object has the following associated objects. If the API version isn’t specified, they’re available in the same API versions as this object.
Otherwise, they’re available in the specified API version and later.

**EventChangeEvent (API version 44.0)**
Change events are available for the object.

**EventFeed (API version 20.0)**
Feed tracking is available for the object.
