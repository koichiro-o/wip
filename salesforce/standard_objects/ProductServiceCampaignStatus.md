##### Usage

The Status field on product service campaigns comes with the following values:

**•** New—Product service campaign created, but there hasn’t been any activity.

**•** In Progress—Work has begun.

**•** On Hold—Work is paused.

**•** Completed—Work is complete.

**•** Cannot Complete—Work couldn’t be completed.

**•** Closed—All work and associated activity is complete.

**•** Canceled—Work is canceled, typically before any work began.

The ProductServiceCampaignStatus object corresponds to the Status field. Adding a value to the Status field—for example, Canceled
By Supplier—creates a product service campaign status record, and vice versa.

Note: Product service campaigns also come with a Status Category field whose values are identical to the default status values.
If you create custom status values, you must indicate which category it belongs to. For example, if you create a `Customer`

`Absent` value, add it to the `Cannot Complete` [category. To learn which processes reference StatusCategory, see How are](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=fs_status_categories.htm&language=en_US)
