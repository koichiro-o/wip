#### OrderOwnerSharingRule

Represents a rule which determines order sharing access for the orderâ€™s owners.

Note: To enable access to this object for your org, contact Salesforce customer support. However, we recommend that you
instead use Metadata API to programmatically update owner sharing rules because it triggers automatic sharing rule recalculation.
[The SharingRules Metadata API type is enabled for all orgs.](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.254.0.api_meta.meta/api_meta/meta_sharingrules.htm)

Use this object to manage the sharing rules for orders. For example, the following code creates an order owner sharing rule between
two public groups, which can also contain portal users.
```
OrderOwnerSharingRule rule = new OrderOwnerSharingRule();
rule.setName("RuleName"); // Set the sharing rule name
rule.setDeveloperName("RuleDeveloperName"); // Set the sharing rule developer name
rule.setGroupId("00Gx00000000000"); // Set the group of users to share records from
rule.setUserOrGroupId("00Gx00000000001"); // Set the group of users to share records to
rule.setOrderAccessLevel("Edit");
connection.create(rule);
