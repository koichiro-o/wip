#### Task

Represents a business activity such as making a phone call or other to-do items. In the user interface, Task and Event records are collectively
referred to as activities.

Note: Task fields related to calls are exclusive to Salesforce CRM Call Center. Also, `query(),` `delete(), and` `update()`
aren't allowed with tasks related to more than one contact in API versions 23.0 and earlier.

##### Supported Calls
```
create(), delete(), describeLayout(), describeSObjects(), getDeleted(), getUpdated(), query(),
retrieve(), search(), undelete(), update(), upsert()

 Fields

```
```
AccountId

```

**Type**
reference

**Properties**
Filter, Group, Nillable, Sort

**Description**
Represents the ID of the related Account. The `AccountId` is determined as follows.

If the value of WhatId is any of these objects, Salesforce uses that object's AccountId.

**•** Account

**•** Opportunity

**•** Contract


-----

```
ActivityDate
CallDisposition
CallDurationInSeconds

```


**•** Custom object that is a child of Account

If the value of the WhatIdfield is any other object, and the value of the WhoId field is a
Contact object, then Salesforce uses that contact’s AccountId. (If your organization uses
Shared Activities, then Salesforce uses the `AccountId` of the primary contact.)

Otherwise, Salesforce sets the value of the `AccountId field to` `null.`

For information on IDs, see ID Field Type.

This is a relationship field.

**Type**
picklist

**Properties**
Create, Filter, Group, Nillable, Restricted picklist, Sort, Update

**Description**
Represents what triggers a repeating task to repeat. Add this field to a page layout together
with the RecurrenceInterval field, which determines the number of days between
the triggering date (due date or close date) and the due date of the next repeating task in
the series.

Label is Repeat This Task. This field has the following picklist values:

**•** **None: The task doesn’t repeat.**

**•** **After due date: The next repeating task will be due the specified number of days after**
the current task’s due date.

**•** **After the task is closed: The next repeating task will be due the specified number of**
days after the current task is closed.

**•** **(Task closed): This task, now closed, was opened as part of a repeating series.**

When tasks in a series are set to repeat after their due date, Salesforce doesn’t create
recurrences that would have been due in the past. Instead, Salesforce keeps adding the
interval until a repeated task has a due date in the future.

For example, suppose that someone sets a task to repeat three days after it’s due. But, that
person doesn’t complete the task (mark it Closed) until five days after it’s due. Instead of
creating a task that’s already overdue, Salesforce gives the new task a due date of tomorrow.
This due date is equivalent to 6 days after the due date; two intervals of three days each.

If that person completes the repeating task (marks it Closed) before the due date, the next
task is still due three days after the due date.

**Description**

The WhoId represents a human such as a lead or a contact. WhoIds are polymorphic.
Polymorphic means a WhoId is equivalent to a contact’s ID or a lead’s ID. The label is `Name`
```
  ID.

```
If Shared Activities is enabled, the value of this field is the ID of the related lead or primary
contact. If you add, update, or remove the WhoId field, you might encounter problems with
triggers, workflows, and data validation rules that are associated with the record. The label
is Name ID.

Beginning in API version 37.0, if the contact or lead ID in the `WhoId` field is not in the
`TaskWhoIds` list, no error occurs and the ID is added to the TaskWhoIds as the primary
`WhoId. If WhoId` is set to null, an arbitrary ID from the existing TaskWhoIds list is
promoted to the primary position.

This is a polymorphic relationship field.

##### Usage

**Recurring Tasks**

**•** Recurring tasks are available in API version 16.0 and later.

**•** After a task is created, it can’t be changed from recurring to nonrecurring or vice versa.

**•** When a user creates a series of recurring tasks, Salesforce creates a main record and subsequent occurrences. For the main record,
`IsRecurrence` is set to `true` and other fields that define the recurrence pattern are populated. The ID of the main record of
the recurring task is saved in the subsequent occurrences, in the RecurrenceActivityId field.

**•** When you delete a recurring task series through the API, all open and closed task occurrences in the series are removed. However,
when you delete a recurring task series through the user interface, only open tasks occurrences (IsClosed is `false) in the`
series are removed.

**•** If IsRecurrence is true, then RecurrenceStartDateOnly, RecurrenceEndDateOnly, RecurrenceType,
and any properties associated with the given recurrence type (see the following table) must be populated.

**•** When you change the `RecurrenceStartDateOnly` field or the recurrence pattern, all open tasks occurrences in the series
are deleted and new open task occurrences are created based on the new recurrence pattern. The following fields determine the
recurrence pattern: `RecurrenceType, RecurrenceTimeZoneSidKey, RecurrenceInterval,`
```
  RecurrenceDayOfWeekMask, RecurrenceDayOfMonth, RecurrenceInstance, and
  RecurrenceMonthOfYear.

```
**•** When you change the value of `RecurrenceEndDateOnly to an earlier date (for example, from January 20 to January 10), all`
open task occurrences in the series with the ActivityDate value greater than the new end date value are deleted. Other open
and closed task occurrences in the series are not affected.

**•** When you change the value of `RecurrenceEndDateOnly to a later date (for example, from January 10 to January 20), new`
task occurrences are created up to the new end date. Existing open and closed tasks in the series are not affected.

This table describes the usage of recurrence fields for Salesforce Classic recurring events. Each recurrence type must have all of its
properties set. All unused properties must be set to null.

**RecurrenceType Value** **Properties** **Example Pattern**

RecursDaily RecurrenceInterval Every second day

RecursEveryWeekday RecurrenceDayOfWeekMask Every weekday - can’t be Saturday or Sunday

RecursMonthly RecurrenceDayOfMonth Every second month, on the third day of the month

-----

**JunctionIdList**

The `JunctionIdList` field is now implemented in the Event and Task objects. With a single API call, it’s easy to create
many-to-many relationships between the Event or Task object with contacts, leads, or users.

To create a Task with related Contacts without `JunctionIdList, you first have to create the task, then use the returned task`
ID to create the TaskRelation records. If the TaskRelation save call fails, error handling is your responsibility because the
task has already been committed to the database.
```
  public void createTasksOld(Contact[] contacts) {
   Task task = new Task();
   task.setSubject("New Task");
   SaveResult[] results = null;
   try {
   results = connection.create(new Task[] {
    task
   });
   if (results[0].isSuccess()) {
    TaskRelation[] relations = new TaskRelation[contacts.size()];
    for (int i = 0; i < contacts.length; i++) {
    relations[i] = new TaskRelation();
    relations[i].setTaskId(results[0].getID());
    relations[i].setRelationId(contacts[i].getID());
    }
    results = connection.create(relations);
   }
   } catch (ConnectionException ce) {
   ce.printStackTrace();
   }
  }

```
To create a task using `JuncionIdList, IDs are pulled from the related contacts and both the task and the TaskRelation`
records are created in one API call. If the `TaskRelation` fails, the task is rolled back because it’s all done in a single API call.
```
  public void createTaskNew(Contact[] contacts) {
   String[] contactIds = new String[contacts.size()];
   for (int i = 0; i < contacts.size(); i++) {
   contactIds[i] = contacts[i].getID();
   }
   Task task = new Task();
   task.setSubject("New Task");
   task.setTaskWhoIds(contactIds);
   SaveResult[] results = null;
   try {
   results = connection.create(new Task[] {
    task
   });
   } catch (ConnectionException ce) {
   ce.printStackTrace();
   }
  }

```
**Shared Field-Level Security for Event and Task Objects**

Metadata deployments for the Task object should always include the field-level security for the Event object. Shared field-level security
prevents each object from changing the field-level security of the associated object.


-----

Metadata deployments that include field-level security for only one of either the Event or Task objects can cause field-level security
changes to the other object that aren't reflected in the metadata.

**•** If field-level security is enabled for one object, then field-level security is enabled for both objects.

**•** If field-level security is disabled for one object, then it's disabled for both objects.

Note: A missing entry in the metadata is treated as field-level security being disabled.

##### Associated Objects

This object has the following associated objects. If the API version isn’t specified, they’re available in the same API versions as this object.
Otherwise, they’re available in the specified API version and later.

**TaskChangeEvent (API version 44.0)**
Change events are available for the object.

**TaskFeed (API version 20.0)**
Feed tracking is available for the object.
