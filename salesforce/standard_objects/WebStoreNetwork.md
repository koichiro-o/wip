##### Usage

After you copy web store data between a sandbox and production, or between sandboxes, you can programmatically associate the
copy with a different site by updating the corresponding WebStoreNetwork record. You can even change the association while the store
is active. The site must use a template that’s compatible with the web store type, and the site can’t be associated with a store. Otherwise,
you can change the association only by editing the web store in the UI.
