##### Usage

This object helps you replicate the related list functionality of the Salesforce user interface for approval processes. Use ProcessInstanceHistory
for a unified read-only view of the ProcessInstanceStep and ProcessInstanceWorkItem objects. You canâ€™t query ProcessInstanceHistory.
Instead, you can query ProcessInstanceHistory by including it in a nested query on the parent ProcessInstance object. For example, this


-----

SOQL query returns all the ProcessInstanceHistory records related to individual ProcessInstance records. The nested query references
`StepsAndWorkitems, which is the child` `relationshipName` for ProcessInstanceHistory in the ProcessInstance object.
```
SELECT Id, (SELECT Id, StepStatus, Comments FROM StepsAndWorkitems)
  FROM ProcessInstance

```
This object respects field-level security on the parent object.
