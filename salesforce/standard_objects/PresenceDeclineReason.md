#### PresenceDeclineReason

Represents an Omni-Channel decline reason that agents can select when declining work requests. This object is available in API version
37.0 and later.

Important: Where possible, we changed noninclusive terms to align with our company value of Equality. Because changing
terms in our code can break current implementations, we maintained this object’s name.

**Description**
The unique name of the object in the API. This name can contain only underscores and
alphanumeric characters, and must be unique in your org. It must begin with a letter, not
include spaces, not end with an underscore, and not contain two consecutive underscores.
In managed packages, this field prevents naming conflicts on package installations. With
this field, a developer can change the object’s name in a managed package and the changes
are reflected in a subscriber’s organization.

Note: When creating large sets of data, always specify a unique DeveloperName
for each record. If no DeveloperName is specified, performance slows down while
Salesforce generates one for each record.

permission can view, group, sort, and filter this field.
