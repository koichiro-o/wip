#### ReplyText

A text reply generated by Einstein Reply Recommendations that is based on closed chat transcripts. Admins review replies and publish
them to quick text, editing them as needed. Einstein recommends relevant published replies to support agents in the Lightning Service
Console, and agents can insert replies into chats or messaging sessions. This object is available in API version 49.0 and later.

Important: Because the replies generated by Einstein are taken from closed chats with your customers, they may contain customer
data. You can edit replies before they are recommended to agents.

To get started with Einstein Reply Recommendations, create a predictive model that analyzes closed chats for frequently used text
snippets. When the model is ready, Einstein generates a list of these snippets as ReplyText records for you to review and publish, or
convert, to quick text. ReplyText records appear on the Einstein Reply Recommendations Setup page.

You can select one or more replies to publish at a time. If you publish a single reply, you can edit the reply text during publishing. If you
publish multiple replies at once, you can edit each reply’s text on the quick text page after publishing is complete. Replies aren’t
recommended to support agents until you activate your reply recommendation model.

When a reply is published, a corresponding QuickText record is created. During publishing, select a quick text folder to add the replies
to and make sure that agents have access to the folder. To edit a reply after it is published, edit the related quick text record.

Einstein generates the list of replies only once, when your model finishes building. It’s not possible to generate a new list.
