#### LocationGroup

Represents a group of Omnichannel Inventory locations, providing an aggregate view of inventory availability across those locations.
Omnichannel Inventory can create an inventory reservation for an order at the location group level, then assign the reservation to one
or more locations in the group as needed. This object is available in API version 51.0 and later.

You can define location groups according to the logic of your business needs. For example, a location group can represent the warehouses
in a geographic region, or it can include the fulfillment centers associated with a particular online storefront.
