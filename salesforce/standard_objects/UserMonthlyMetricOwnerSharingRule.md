#### UserMonthlyMetricOwnerSharingRule

Represents the rules for sharing the user monthly metric with users other than the owner.

Note: To enable access to this object for your org, contact Salesforce customer support. However, we recommend that you
instead use Metadata API to programmatically update owner sharing rules because it triggers automatic sharing rule recalculation.
[The SharingRules Metadata API type is enabled for all orgs.](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.254.0.api_meta.meta/api_meta/meta_sharingrules.htm)

**Description**
The unique name of the object in the API. This name can contain only underscores
and alphanumeric characters, and must be unique in your org. It must begin with a
letter, not include spaces, not end with an underscore, and not contain two
consecutive underscores. In managed packages, this field prevents naming conflicts
on package installations. With this field, a developer can change the object’s name
in a managed package and the changes are reflected in a subscriber’s organization.

Note: When creating large sets of data, always specify a unique
`DeveloperName` for each record. If no `DeveloperName` is specified,
performance slows down while Salesforce generates one for each record.

the rule to give access.
