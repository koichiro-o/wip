#### MessagingChannelUsage

Represents the status of an enhanced Messaging channel or of an application in a Unified Messaging channel. This object is available in
API version 60.0 and later.

A MessagingChannel can be associated with up to three MessagingChannelUsage records, each with a unique DeploymentType. The
role of a MessagingChannelUsage record differs slightly depending on whether it's used in an enhanced Messaging channel or a Unified
Messaging channel.

**•** In enhanced WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, Apple Messages for Business, and LINE channels, each channel has one associated
MessagingChannelUsage record with a DeploymentType of Conversation. The MessagingChannelUsage record determines
the channel's flow of messaging traffic. When you activate such a channel in Setup, its MessagingChannelUsage record updates to


-----

use a `DeploymentStatus` of `Active, and messaging traffic can flow to and from Salesforce. Similarly, deactivating the`
channel in Setup causes its MessagingChannelUsage record to update to a DeploymentStatus of Disabled, and stops the
flow of messaging traffic.

**•** In Unified Messaging channels, the MessagingChannelUsage record represents the status of a connected Service Cloud or Marketing
Cloud application. For example, if a WhatsApp Unified Messaging channel is connected to both Service Cloud and Marketing Cloud,
the MessagingChannel record has two associated MessagingChannelUsage records with a DeploymentType of Conversation
and `MJ, respectively. These MessagingChannelUsage records are created when a user selects the Marketing or Service application`
during Unified Messaging setup.

**Description**
Applicable only to MessagingChannelUsage records with a deployment type of MJ (Marketing
Cloud). RoutingOverride indicates how messages are delivered in a unified channel where
both the Service and Marketing applications are connected.

Possible values are:

**•** `MJKeywordsOnly—If a messaging user sends a marketing keyword that is defined`
in Journey Builder, Journey Builder handles the message delivery and response. If a
messaging user sends a non-keyword message, Omni-Channel handles the message
delivery and response.

**•** `NonSessionMessages—If a messaging user is engaged in an active Service Cloud`
messaging session, Service Cloud handles message delivery and response. If the user
isn’t engaged in an active session, Journey Builder handles message delivery and response.

Regardless of the RoutingOverride value, outbound messages are always handled by Service
Cloud if the messaging user is engaged in an active Service Cloud messaging session. A
session is considered active if its status isn't Ended or Error.
