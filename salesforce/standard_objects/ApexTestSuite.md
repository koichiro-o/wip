Insert a TestSuiteMembership object using an API call to associate an Apex class with an ApexTestSuite object. (ApexTestSuite and
TestSuiteMembership arenâ€™t editable through Apex DML.) To remove the class from the test suite, delete the TestSuiteMembership
object. If you delete an Apex test class or test suite, all TestSuiteMembership objects that contain that class or suite are deleted.

The following SOQL query returns the membership object that relates this Apex class to this test suite.
```
SELECT Id FROM TestSuiteMembership WHERE ApexClassId = '01pD0000000Fhy9IAC'
   AND ApexTestSuiteId = '05FD00000004CDBMA2'
