This object represents the association of a knowledge article with a Case. An article is associated with a case when itâ€™s relevant to a
specific issue, when it helps an agent solve the case, or when the agent sends the article to a customer.

You can use this object to include case-article associations in Apex and Visualforce.

You can't update this object via the API. If you attempt to create a record that matches an existing record, the create request simply
returns the existing record.
