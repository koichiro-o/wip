Use the BuyerGroupPricebook object to assign a price book to a set of buyer users. Assigning a price book to a buyer group allows buyers
within that buyer group to retrieve product prices from the price book. When a buyer has multiple price book assignments, including
multiple prices for the same product, the store Pricing Strategy determines the price.
